We catched the robot from Mr.Lahti from Applied Application Project course.
We worked on it with 2 sensor color sensor and ultrasonic sensor to robot detect the black line and find the obstacle.
now we created the website from that the robot catched the speed from user and uploaded in database and we have 2 table in database speeds and info.
In info table we have 2 column first time and distance.
We learn more thing in class and read many thing from sites and our friends.
We worked with together at 5 classes in 82 folder and about sites in "New" folder.
We had many problem in database and connect the robot to dabase and conversely.
thank you Mr.Pentti
